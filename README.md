# Airbnb Clone - ALX Project

## Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone is a project developed as part of the ALX Software Engineering Program.
The main goal is to build a simplified version of the Airbnb web application, focusing on:

i.   Designing a backend system that handles data management.
ii.  Implementing a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the system.
iii. Creating storage systems (File storage and later Database storage).
iv.  Developing a dynamic web interface with HTML, CSS, and eventually JavaScript.
v.   Deploying the application on a server.

This project is designed to help us understand how full-stack web applications are built from scratch by progressively integrating different components.

## Project Goals

User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Tech Stack

Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Team Roles
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.
