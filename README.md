# Airbnb Clone - ALX Project

## Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone is a project developed as part of the ALX Software Engineering Program.
The main goal is to build a simplified version of the Airbnb web application, focusing on:

i.   Designing a backend system that handles data management.
ii.  Implementing a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the system.
iii. Creating storage systems (File storage and later Database storage).
iv.  Developing a dynamic web interface with HTML, CSS, and eventually JavaScript.
v.   Deploying the application on a server.

This project is designed to help us understand how full-stack web applications are built from scratch by progressively integrating different components.

## Project Goals

User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Technology Stack

Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: Used for handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Team Roles
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## Database Design
This project is built around several core entities that represent the main features of the platform. Each entity has its own fields and relationships to other entities.

1. Users
Important Fields:
id (unique identifier)
name
email
password (hashed)
role (guest or host)

Relationships:
A user (host) can own multiple properties.
A user (guest) can make multiple bookings.
A user can leave multiple reviews.

2. Properties
Important Fields:
id
title
description
location
price_per_night

Relationships:
A property belongs to a single user (host).
A property can have multiple bookings.
A property can have multiple reviews.

3. Bookings
Important Fields:
id
user_id (guest)
property_id
start_date
end_date
status (e.g., pending, confirmed, cancelled)

Relationships:
A booking belongs to a user (guest).
A booking is linked to a specific property.
A booking may be tied to a payment.

4. Reviews
Important Fields:
id
user_id (guest who leaves review)
property_id
rating (1–5 stars)
comment

Relationships:
A review is written by a user (guest).
A review is associated with one property.

5. Payments
Important Fields:
id
booking_id
amount
payment_method (e.g., card, PayPal)
status (successful, failed, pending)

Relationships:
A payment is linked to a booking.
A user (guest) makes the payment.



## Feature Breakdown
1. API Documentation
OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
2. User Authentication
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
3. Property Management
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. Booking System
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
5. Payment Processing
Endpoints: /payments/
Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
6. Review System
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
7. Database Optimizations
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## API Security
Security is a critical part of building this project, since it involves sensitive user data, financial transactions, and real-time interactions. Below are the key security measures we plan to implement:

Authentication
Verifying the identity of users (e.g., login with username/email & password, sessions, tokens).
It’s important as it protects user accounts and ensures that only legitimate users can access their profiles and data.

Authorization
Controlling what authenticated users can do (e.g., a guest can book a stay but cannot manage another host’s listings).
It’s important as it prevents unauthorized access to sensitive resources and maintains data integrity

Data Encryption
Encrypting sensitive data (e.g., passwords, personal information) both in transit (HTTPS/SSL) and at rest (database encryption).
This protects user data from leaks or interception by attackers.

Rate Limiting & Throttling
Restricting the number of requests a user or bot can make in a given time.
It prevents denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and protects the platform from abuse (e.g., spamming booking requests).

Input Validation & Sanitization
Checking and cleaning user inputs before processing them.
It protects against SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other injection attacks.

Secure Payments (Future Feature)
Using trusted third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) that follow PCI-DSS standards.
It ensures financial transactions are processed securely, building trust with users.

Logging & Monitoring
Keeping track of user activity and system performance.
It helps detect suspicious behavior, possible breaches, and performance issues early.

## CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery) refers to a set of practices that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications.

Continuous Integration (CI): Ensures that every change (new feature, bug fix, etc.) pushed to the repository is automatically tested and validated. This helps catch errors early and ensures that the codebase remains stable.

Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD): Automates the process of deploying tested changes into production or staging environments, reducing manual work and speeding up the release cycle.

Why It’s Important for the Airbnb Clone Project:

Ensures reliability: Every change is tested before integration.
Speeds up development: Automates repetitive tasks like testing and deployment.
Facilitates collaboration: Multiple team members can contribute without breaking the project.
Improves quality: Automated tests catch bugs early, improving software stability.
Deployment ready: Makes it easier to ship updates to users seamlessly

Tools Used
GitHub Actions → Automate testing, linting, and deployment workflows directly from GitHub.
Docker → Containerize the application, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
Jenkins → Popular automation server for building CI/CD pipelines.
Travis CI / CircleCI → Cloud-based CI/CD platforms that integrate with GitHub.
Nginx → For serving and deploying the web application in production.
